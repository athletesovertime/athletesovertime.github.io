	<h3>The 1920's was known as the Golden Age of sports. 
The interest in sports increased as more people began to pay attention
The media played a big part in this while sports gained more publicity and
promotion. The most popular sports in that decade include baseball, 
boxing, and college football. Along with this famous athlete
 <a class="lc"href="baberuth.html">Babe Ruth</a> 
dominated this decade in being one of the most famous athletes in baseball history. 
There were other many famous athletes of the 1920's including Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, 
Helen Wills, 'Red" Grange, Gertrude Edlerle, Joe Lewis, and Satchel Paige. Majority of these athletes
are male while during this time period sports were male dominated. Competitive and athletic women were 
seen as an unattractive trait. There were some exceptions for women to play sports such as archery, tennis,
croquet and golf, but anything more intense or competitive was not acceptable.    </h3>
