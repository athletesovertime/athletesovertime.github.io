<h3>The events of Pearl Harbor, which occurred on December 7, 1941, had an impact on the sports <br> 
industry in the 1940s. Even though the majority of professional and collegiate athletes qualified <br>
for the military, they enlisted. Baseball, which had formerly been a well-liked sport, was now in <br>
danger of being discontinued. Professional sports became a significant industry after the war. <br>
Along with the end of the Great Depression, sporting event attendance was once again on the rise.<br>
American sports gradually merged with the entertainment industry. Overall there were major <br>
advancements, Such as new aircraft technology and the widespread use of television, causing <br>
top players' incomes to skyrocket.
