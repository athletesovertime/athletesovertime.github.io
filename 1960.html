<h3>The 1960's was very significant for sports. Including the first Super Bowl being held in 1967.
The New York Yankees dominated the first season of 1960's baseball, but in 1962 their rivals were
born, and New York had welcomed the Mets. In the late 1960's athletes like Bob Gibson and Sandy 
Koufax had so much impact on the sport that they had a major influence on the change of rules in 
Baseball. Many athletes had a major impact on the world. Sports paralleled events happening around
the world, as athletes spoke up and against real world issues. For example
 <a class="lc"href="process.html">Wilma Rudolph</a>, a sprinter
who had multiple record breaking Olympic performances, fought for gender equality. </h3>
