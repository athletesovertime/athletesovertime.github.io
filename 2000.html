<h3>The 2000's sports industry was filled with new achievements, players and controversy.<br>
While NFL players arrests were common, most marquee players stay away from off the field <br>
problems. But on Jan 31st, Ray Lewis, a superstar linebacker of Baltimore Ravens was involved <br>
in a bar fight and was indicted on charges of murder. In this decade we see an introduction<br>
towards well known athletes today. Including Tiger woods;(a professional golf player) who won<br>
the Laureus World Sportsman and Sportswomen of the year award in 2001. Marion Jones (former world<br>
champion in track and field) also won the award but later on admitted that she used performance <br>
enhancing drugs. Along in the 2000's Usain Bolt gained his titles as the fastest man alive. <br>
He broke the world records both in the 100 and 200 meter dashes at the Beijing Olympics. <br>
Ironically, Usian later broke his own world record by winning 200 meter event in 19.19 seconds<br>
and 100 meter in just 9.58 seconds. Technology also improved overtime allowing an imporvment in sorts aswell.<br>
A tool called "Eye Hawk" changed sports like tennis with a ball tracking software. </h3>
